You don't always want to be\nmiserable on my birthday, do you?\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n\"It's bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking\ndown, \"being miserable myself, what with no pres-\nents and no cake and no candles, and no proper\nnotice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is\ngoing to be miserable too--\"\nThis was too much for Pooh. \"Stay there!\" he\ncalled to Eeyore, as he turned and hurried back\nhome as quick as he could; for he felt that he must\nget poor Eeyore a present of some sort at once, and\nhe could always think of a proper one afterwards.\nوالی مخلوق\n274\nRNIG\nALSO\nMB SAUDEN\nDigitized by\nT\nOutside his house he found Piglet, jumping up\nand down trying to reach the knocker.\nGoogle\n76\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet.\n\"What are you trying to do?\"\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"I was trying to reach the knocker,\" said Piglet.\n\"I just came round——”\n\"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly. So he\nreached up and knocked at the door. \"I have just\nseen Eeyore,\" he began, \"and poor Eeyore is in a\nVery Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and\nnobody has taken any notice of it, and he's very\nGloomy-you know what Eeyore is and there he\nwas, and- What a long time whoever lives here\nis answering this door.\" And he knocked again.\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. “So it is,” he said. “Well, let's\ngo in.\"\nSo in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to\ngo to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar\nof honey left; and he had, so he took it down.\n\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a\npresent. What are you going to give?\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY\n77\n\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both\nof us?\"\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would not be a good\nplan.\"\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got\none left from my party. I'll go and get it now,\nshall I?\"\n“That, Piglet, is a very good idea. It is just what\nEeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be un-\ncheered with a balloon.\"\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction\nwent Pooh, with his jar of honey.\nIt was a warm day, and he had a long way to go.\nHe hadn't gone more than half-way when a sort of\nfunny feeling began to creep all over him. It began\nat the tip of his nose and trickled all through him\nand out at the soles of his feet. It was just as if\nsomebody inside him were saying, \"Now then,\nPooh, time for a little something.\"\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, “I didn't know it was as\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n78\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"\"\nlate as that.\" So he sat down and took the top off\nhis jar of honey. “Lucky I brought this with me,'\nhe thought. \"Many a bear going out on a warm day\nlike this would never have thought of bringing a\nlittle something with him.\" And he began to eat.\n\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last\nlick of the inside of the jar, \"where was I going?\nAh, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly.\nAnd then, suddenly, he remembered. He had\neaten Eeyore's birthday present!\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"What shall I do? I must\ngive him something.\"\nFor a little while he couldn't think of anything.\nThen he thought: \"Well, it's a very nice pot, even\nif there's no honey in it, and if I washed it clean,\nand got somebody to write 'A Happy Birthday' on\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n7\n1\n;\n1\n1\n3\n1\nEEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY\n79\nit, Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be\nUseful.\" So, as he was just passing the Hundred\nAcre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\nlived there.\n\"Good morning, Owl,” he said.\n\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.\n\"Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday,\" said\nPooh.\n\"Oh, is that what it is?\"\n\"What are you giving him, Owl?\"\n\"What are you giving him, Pooh?\"\n\"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In,\nand I wanted to ask you--\"\n\"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.\n\"Yes, and I wanted to ask you-'\n\"\"\n\"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\" said\nOwl.\n\"You can keep any thing in it,\" said Pooh earnestly.\n\"It's Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask\nyou--\"\n\"You ought to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it.\"\n“That was what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh.\n\"Because my spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling\nbut it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong\nplaces. Would you write 'A Happy Birthday' on it\nfor me?\"\n\"It's a nice pot,\" said Owl, looking at it all round.\n\"Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?”\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n80\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would not be a good plan.\nNow I'll just wash it first, and then you can write\non it.\"\nWell, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while\nOwl licked the end of his pencil, and wondered\nhow to spell \"birthday.\"\n\"Can you read, Pooh?\" he asked, a little anxiously.\n\"There's a notice about knocking and ringing out-\nside my door, which Christopher Robin wrote.\nCould you read it?\"\n\"Christopher Robin told me what it said, and then\nI could.\"\n\"Well, I'll tell you what this says, and then you'll\nbe able to.\"\nSo Owl wrote... and this is what he wrote:\nHIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA\nBTHUTHDY.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEEYORE HAS ♪ BIRTHDAY\nPooh looked on admiringly.\n\"I'm just saying ‘A Happy Birthday,”” said Owl\ncarelessly.\n81\n\"It's a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much im-\npressed by it.\n\"Well, actually, of course, I'm saying 'A Very\nHappy Birthday with love from Pooh.' Naturally\nit takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing\nlike that.\"\n\"Oh, I see,” said Pooh.\nWhile all this was happening, Piglet had gone\nback to his own house to get Eeyore's balloon.\nHe held it very tightly against himself, so that it\nshouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could\nso as to get to Eeyore before Pooh did; for he\nthought that he would like to be the first one to\ngive a present, just as if he had thought of it with-\nout being told by anybody. And running along,\nand thinking how pleased Eeyore would be, he\ndidn't look where he was going . and suddenly\nhe put his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat\non his face\nDigitized by Google\n82\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nBANG!!!???***!!!\nPiglet lay there, wondering what had happened.\nAt first he thought that the whole world had blown\nup; and then he thought that perhaps only the For-\nest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps\nonly he had, and he was now alone in the moon or\nsomewhere, and would never see Christopher Robin\nor Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought,\n“Well, even if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face\ndownwards all the time,\" so he got cautiously up\nand looked about him.\nHe was still in the Forest!\n\"Well, that's funny,\" he thought. \"I wonder what\nthat bang was. I couldn't have made such a noise\njust falling down. And where's my balloon? And\nwhat's that small piece of damp rag doing?\"\nIt was the balloon!\n\"Oh, dear!\" said Piglet. \"Oh, dear, oh, dearie,\ndearie, dear! Well, it's too late now. I can't go\nback, and I haven't another balloon, and perhaps\nEeyore doesn't like balloons so very much.”\nSo he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he\ncame to the side of the stream where Eeyore was,\nand called out to him.\n\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" shouted Piglet.\n“Good morning, Little Piglet,” said Eeyore. “If it\nis a good morning,\" he said. “Which I doubt,\" said\nhe. \"Not that it matters,\" he said.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY\n83\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet,\nhaving now got closer.\nEeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream,\nand turned to stare at Piglet.\n\"Just say that again,\" he said.\n\"Many hap-\n\"Wait a moment.”\n\"\"\n\"\"\nBalancing on three legs, he began to bring his\nfourth leg very cautiously up to his ear. \"I did this\nyesterday,\" he explained, as he fell down for the\nthird time. \"It's quite easy. It's so as I can hear\nbetter. . . . There, that's done it! Now then, what\nwere you saying?\" He pushed his ear forward with\nhis hoof.\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet\nagain.\n\"Meaning me?\"\n\"Of course, Eeyore.\"\n\"My birthday?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Me having a real birthday?\"\n\"Yes, Eeyore, and I've brought you a present.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n"}
