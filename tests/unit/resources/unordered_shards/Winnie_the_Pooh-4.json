I'm Piglet!\"\n\"Don't open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in,\"\nsaid Kanga. \"There! What did I tell you?\"\n\"You-you-you did it on purpose,\" spluttered\nPiglet, as soon as he could speak again... and then\naccidentally had another mouthful of lathery\nflannel.\n\"That's right, dear, don't say anything,\" said\nKanga, and in another minute Piglet was out of the\nbath, and being rubbed dry with a towel.\n\"Now,\" said Kanga, \"there's your medicine, and\nthen bed.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\n\"W-w-what medicine?\" said Piglet.\n\"To make you grow big and strong, dear.

She keeps saying\nI'm Roo. I'm not Roo, am I?”\nChristopher Robin looked at him very carefully,\nand shook his head.\n\"You can't be Roo,\" he said, \"because I've just\nseen Roo playing in Rabbit's house.\"\n\"Well!\" said Kanga. \"Fancy that!

And\nevery Tuesday Roo spent the day with his great\nfriend Rabbit, and every Tuesday Kanga spent the\nday with his great friend Pooh, teaching him to\njump, and every Tuesday Piglet spent the day with\nhis great friend Christopher Robin. So they were\nall happy again.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nCHAPTER VIII\nIN WHICH Christopher Robin Leads\nan Expotition to the\nNorth Pole\nONE\nNE fine day Pooh had stumped\nup to the top of the Forest to see if his friend Chris-\ntopher Robin was interested in Bears at all. At break-\nfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade\nspread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had\nsuddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:\n\"Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear.\"\nWhen he had got as far as this, he stretched his\nhead, and thought to himself \"That's a very good\nstart for a song, but what about the second line?\"\nHe tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it\ndidn't seem to help. \"Perhaps it would be better,\"\nhe thought, \"if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear.\" So\nhe sang it... but it wasn't. \"Very well, then,\" he\nsaid, “I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if\n108\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEXPOTITION TO NORTH POLE\n109\nI sing it very quickly, I shall find myself singing the\nthird and fourth lines before I have time to think of\nthem, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:\"\nSing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\nSing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\nI don't much mind if it rains or snows,\n'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice new nose,\nI don't much care if it snows or thaws,\n'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws!\nSing Ho! for a Bear!\nSing Ho! for a Pooh!\nAnd I'll have a little something in an hour or two!\nHe was so pleased with this song\nthat he sang it\nall the way to the top of the Forest, \"and if I go on\nsinging it much longer,\" he thought, \"it will be time\nfor the little something, and then the last line won't\nbe true.\" So he turned it into a hum instead.\nChristopher Robin was sitting outside his door,\nputting on his Big Boots. As soon as he saw the Big\nBoots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was going to\nhappen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with\nthe back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well\nas he could, so as to look Ready for Anything.\n\"Good-morning, Christopher Robin,\" he called out.\n\"Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get this boot on.\"\n\"That's bad,\" said Pooh.\n\"Do you\nthink you could very kindly lean against\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n110\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nme, 'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over back-\nwards.\"\nPooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and\npushed hard against Christopher Robin's back, and\nChristopher Robin pushed hard against his, and\npulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.\n\"And that's that,\" said Pooh. \"What do we do\nnext?\"\n\"We are all going on an Expedition,” said Chris-\ntopher Robin, as he got up and brushed himself.\n\"Thank you, Pooh.\"\n\"Going on an Expotition?\" said Pooh eagerly. \"I\ndon't think I've ever been on one of those. Where\nare we going to on this Expotition?'\n\"Expedition, silly old Bear. It's got an 'x' in it.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. “I know.” But he didn't really.\n\"We're going to discover the North Pole.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh again. \"What is the North Pole?\"\nhe asked.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n}\n3\n€\n1\nEXPOTITION TO NORTH POLE\n\"It's just a thing you discover,” said Christopher\nRobin carelessly, not being quite sure himself.\n\"Oh! I see,\" said Pooh. \"Are bears any good at dis-\ncovering it?\"\n\"Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and\nall of you. It's an Expedition. That's what an Ex-\npedition means. A long line of everybody. You'd\nbetter tell the others to get ready, while I see if my\ngun's all right. And we must all bring Provisions.\"\n\"Bring what?\"\n\"Things to eat.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh happily. \"I thought you said Pro-\nvisions. I'll go and tell them.\" And he stumped off.\nwh\nThe first person he met was Rabbit.\nIII\nDigitized by\n-\nGoogle\n112\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"Hallo, Rabbit,\" he said, “is that you?\"\n\"Let's pretend it isn't,\" said Rabbit, “and see what\nhappens.\"\n\"I've got a message for you.\"\n\"I'll give it to him.”\n\"We're all going on an Expotition with Christo-\npher Robin!\"\n\"What is it when we're on it?\"\n\"A sort of boat, I think,\" said Pooh.\n\"Oh! that sort.'\n\"Yes. And we're going to discover a Pole or some-\nthing. Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we're going to\ndiscover it.\"\n“We are, are we?\" said Rabbit.\n\"Yes. And we've got to bring Pro-things to eat\nvith us. In case we want to eat them. Now I'm go-\ning down to Piglet's. Tell Kanga, will you?\"\nHe left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet's house.\nThe Piglet was sitting on the ground at the door of\nhis house blowing happily at a dandelion, and won-\nDigitized by Google\n1\n1\n;\nk\n---\nEXPOTITION TO NORTH POLE\n113\ndering whether it would be this year, next year,\nsometime or never. He had just discovered that it\nwould be never, and was trying to remember what\n\"it\" was, and hoping it wasn't anything nice, when\nPooh came up.\n\"Oh! Piglet,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"we're going on\nan Expotition, all of us, with things to eat. To dis-\ncover something.\"\n\"To discover what?\" said Piglet anxiously.\n\"Oh! just something.\"\n\"Nothing fierce?\"\n\"Christopher Robin didn't say anything about\nfierce.
