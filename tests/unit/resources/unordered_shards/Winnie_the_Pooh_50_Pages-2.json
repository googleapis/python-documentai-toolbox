A. MILNE\nwith decorations\nby Ernest H. Shepard\nPUBLISHED BY\nE. P. DUTTON \u0026 CO., INC., NEW YORK\n123\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nIntroduction\n(I₂\nF YOU happen to have read another\nbook about Christopher Robin, you may remember\nthat he once had a swan (or the swan had Christopher\nRobin, I don't know which) and that he used to call\nthis swan Pooh. That was a long time ago, and when\nwe said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we\ndidn't think the swan would want it any more. Well,\nwhen Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting\nname all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once,\nwithout stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-\nPooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh\npart, I will now explain the rest of it.\nYou can't be in London for long without going to\nthe Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo\nat the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly\nas they can past every cage until they get to the one\ncalled WAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight\nto the animal they love the most, and stay there. So\nwhen Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to\nwhere the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something\nto the third keeper from the left, and doors are un-\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nviii\nlocked, and we wander through dark passages and up\nsteep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,\nand the cage is opened, and out trots something brown\nand furry, and with a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Chris-\ntopher Robin rushes into its arms. Now this bear's\nname is Winnie, which shows what a good name for\nbears it is, but the funny thing is that we can't remem-\nber whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after\nWinnie. We did know once, but we have forgot-\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nten.\nI had written as far as this when Piglet looked up\nand said in his squeaky voice, “What about Me?\"\n\"My dear Piglet,\" I said, \"the whole book is about\nyou.\" \"So it is about Pooh,\" he squeaked. You see\nwhat it is. He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is hav-\ning a Grand Introduction all to himself. Pooh is the\nfavourite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet\ncomes in for a good many things which Pooh misses;\nbecause you can't take Pooh to school without every-\nbody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he slips\ninto a pocket, where it is very comfortable to feel him\nwhen you are not quite sure whether twice seven is\ntwelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has\na good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got\nmore education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn't mind.\nSome have brains, and some haven't, he says, and there\nit is.\nAnd now all the others are saying, \"What about\nUs?\" So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writ-\ning Introductions and get on with the book. A. A. M.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nIN WHICH We Are Introduced to\nCHAPTER I\nWinnie-the-Pooh and Some\nBees, and the Stories Begin\nHERE is Edward Bear, coming\ndownstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back\nof his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far\nas he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,\nbut sometimes he feels that there really is another\nway, if only he could stop bumping for a moment\nand think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there\nisn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready\nto be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.\nWhen I first heard his name, I said, just as you\nare going to say, \"But I thought he was a boy?\"\n\"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\"Then you can't call him Winnie?\"\n\"I don't.\"\n\"But you said--\"\n\"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what\n'ther' means?”\nI\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n“Ah, yes, now I do,\" I said quickly; and I hope\nyou do too, because it is all the explanation you are\ngoing to get.\nSometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some\nsort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he\nlikes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a\nstory. This evening-\n\"What about a story?\" said Christopher Robin.\n\"What about a story?\" I said.\n\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh\none?\"\n\"I suppose I could,\" I said. \"What sort of stories\ndoes he like?\"\n\"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\"So could you very sweetly?\"\n\"I'll try,\" I said.\nSo I tried,\nOnce upon a time, a very long time ago now,\nabout last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest\nall by himself under the name of Sande.s.\n(\"What does 'under the name' mean?\" asked\nChristopher Robin.\n\"It means he had the name over the door in gold\nletters, and lived under it.”\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nAB SANDER\nRNIG\nAALSO\n\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,\" said Chris-\ntopher Robin.\n\"Now I am,\" said a growly voice.\n\"Then I will go on,\" said I.)\n3\nOne day when he was out walking, he came to\nan open place in the middle of the forest, and in the\nmiddle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from\nthe top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.\nWinnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree,\nput his head between his paws and began to think.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n4\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nFirst of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-\nnoise means something. You don't get a buzzing-\nnoise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without\nits meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise,\nsomebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only\nreason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is\nbecause you're a bee.\"\nThen he thought another long time, and said:\n\"And the only reason for being a bee that I know\nof is making honey.\"\nAnd then he got up, and said: “And the only\nreason for making honey is so as I can eat it.\" So he\nbegan to climb the tree.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nK\nDigitized by\nHe\nclimbed\nand\nhe\n5.\nclimbed\nand\nhe\nclimbed,\nand\nas\nhe\nclimbed\nhe\nsang\na\nlittle\nsong\nto\nhimself.\nIt\nwent\nlike\nthis:\nIsn't it funny\nHow a bear likes honey?\nBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!\nI wonder why he does?\nGoogle\n6\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nThen he climbed a little further . . . and a little\nfurther ... and then just a little further. By that\ntime he had thought of another song.\nIt's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,\nThey'd build their nests at the bottom of trees.\nAnd that being so (if the Bees were Bears),\nWe shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.\nHe was getting\nrather tired by this\ntime, so that is why\nhe sang a Complain-\ning Song. He was\nnearly there now,\nand if he just stood\non that branch...\nCrack!\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\n7\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on\nthe branch below him.\n\"If only I hadn't--\" he said, as he bounced\ntwenty feet on to the next branch.\n\"You see, what I meant to do,\" he explained, as he\nturned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another\nbranch thirty feet below, \"what I meant to do--\"\n\"Of course, it was rather--\" he admitted, as he\n'ithered very quickly through the next six branches.\n\"It all comes, I suppose,\" he decided, as he said\ngood-bye to the last branch, spun round three times,\nand flew gracefully into a gorse-bush, \"it all comes\nof liking honey so much. Oh, help!\"\nHe crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the\nprickles from his nose, and began to think again.\nAnd the first person he thought of was Christopher\nRobin.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n"}
