That was a long time ago, and when\nwe said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we\ndidn't think the swan would want it any more. Well,\nwhen Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting\nname all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once,\nwithout stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-\nPooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh\npart, I will now explain the rest of it.\nYou can't be in London for long without going to\nthe Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo\nat the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly\nas they can past every cage until they get to the one\ncalled WAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight\nto the animal they love the most, and stay there. So\nwhen Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to\nwhere the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something\nto the third keeper from the left, and doors are un-\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nviii\nlocked, and we wander through dark passages and up\nsteep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,\nand the cage is opened, and out trots something brown\nand furry, and with a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Chris-\ntopher Robin rushes into its arms. Now this bear's\nname is Winnie, which shows what a good name for\nbears it is, but the funny thing is that we can't remem-\nber whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after\nWinnie. We did know once, but we have forgot-\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nten.\nI had written as far as this when Piglet looked up\nand said in his squeaky voice, “What about Me?\"\n\"My dear Piglet,\" I said, \"the whole book is about\nyou.\" \"So it is about Pooh,\" he squeaked. You see\nwhat it is. He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is hav-\ning a Grand Introduction all to himself. Pooh is the\nfavourite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet\ncomes in for a good many things which Pooh misses;\nbecause you can't take Pooh to school without every-\nbody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he slips\ninto a pocket, where it is very comfortable to feel him\nwhen you are not quite sure whether twice seven is\ntwelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has\na good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got\nmore education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn't mind.\nSome have brains, and some haven't, he says, and there\nit is.\nAnd now all the others are saying, \"What about\nUs?\" So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writ-\ning Introductions and get on with the book.

It is, as far\nas he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,\nbut sometimes he feels that there really is another\nway, if only he could stop bumping for a moment\nand think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there\nisn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready\nto be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.\nWhen I first heard his name, I said, just as you\nare going to say, \"But I thought he was a boy?\"\n\"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\"Then you can't call him Winnie?\"\n\"I don't.\"\n\"But you said--\"\n\"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh.

This evening-\n\"What about a story?\" said Christopher Robin.\n\"What about a story?\" I said.\n\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh\none?\"\n\"I suppose I could,\" I said. \"What sort of stories\ndoes he like?\"\n\"About himself.
