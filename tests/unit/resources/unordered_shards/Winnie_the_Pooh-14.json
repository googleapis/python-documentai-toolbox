It went like this:\n20\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n25\ne\nPOOH GOES VISITING\nTra-la-la, tra-la-la,\nTra-la-la, tra-la-la,\nRum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.\nTiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\nTiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\nRum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n21\nWINNIE-THE-POOR\nWell, he was humming this hum to himself, and\nwalking along gaily, wondering what everybody\nelse was doing, and what it felt like, being some-\nbody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank,\nand in the bank was a large hole.\n\"Aha!\" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) \"If\nI know anything about anything, that hole means\nRabbit,\" he said, \"and Rabbit means Company,\" he\nsaid, “and Company means Food and Listening-to\nMe-Humming and such like.
