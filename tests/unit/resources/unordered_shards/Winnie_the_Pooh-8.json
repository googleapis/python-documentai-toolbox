And then seeing that Owl ex-\npected him to say something else, he said, \"Will\nthere be those little cake things with pink sugar\nicing?\"\nOwl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk\nabout little cake things with pink sugar icing, so he\ntold Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin had said,\nand flew off to Eeyore.\n\"A party for Me?\" thought Pooh to himself. \"How\ngrand!\" And he began to wonder if all the other\nanimals would know that it was a special Pooh\nParty, and if Christopher Robin had told them\nabout The Floating Bear and The Brain of Pooh and\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n148\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nall the wonderful ships he had invented and sailed\non, and he began to think how awful it would be if\neverybody had forgotten about it, and nobody quite\nknew what the party was for; and the more he\nthought like this, the more the party got muddled\nin his mind, like a dream when nothing goes right.\nAnd the dream began to sing itself over in his head\nuntil it became a sort of song.
