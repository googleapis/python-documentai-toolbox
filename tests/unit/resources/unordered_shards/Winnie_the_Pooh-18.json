It was a Special Pencil Case.\nThere were pencils in it marked “B” for Bear, and\npencils marked \"HB\" for Helping Bear, and pencils\nmarked \"BB\" for Brave Bear. There was a knife for\nsharpening the pencils, and india-rubber for rub-\nbing out anything which you had spelt wrong, and\na ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on,\nand inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted\nto know how many inches anything was, and Blue\nPencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for say-\ning special things in blue and red and green.
