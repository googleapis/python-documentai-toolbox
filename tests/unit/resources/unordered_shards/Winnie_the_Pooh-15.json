By that\ntime he had thought of another song.\nIt's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,\nThey'd build their nests at the bottom of trees.\nAnd that being so (if the Bees were Bears),\nWe shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.\nHe was getting\nrather tired by this\ntime, so that is why\nhe sang a Complain-\ning Song.

I just said it to myself, thinking of\nballoons, and wondering.\"\n\"What do you want a balloon for?\" you said.\nWinnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that no-\nbody was listening, put his paw to his mouth, and\nsaid in a deep whisper: \"Honey!\"\n\"But you don't get honey with balloons!\"\n\"I do,\" said Pooh.\nWell, it just happened that you had been to a\nparty the day before at the house of your friend\nPiglet, and you had balloons at the party. You had\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nII\nhad a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's rela-\ntions had had a big blue one, and had left it behind,\nbeing really too young to go to a party at all; and\nso you had brought the green one and the blue one\nhome with you.\n\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh.\nHe put his head between his paws and thought\nvery carefully.\n\"It's like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey\nwith a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees\nknow you're coming. Now, if you have a green\nballoon, they might think you were only part of\nthe tree, and not notice you, and if you have a blue\nballoon, they might think you were only part of\nthe sky, and not notice you, and the question is:\nWhich is most likely?\"\n\"Wouldn't they notice you underneath the bal-\nloon?\"\nyou asked.\n\"They might or they might not,\" said Winnie-\nthe-Pooh. \"You never can tell with bees.\" He\nthought for a moment and said: \"I shall try to look\nlike a small black cloud. That will deceive them.\"\nThen you had better have the blue balloon,\" you\nsaid; and so it was decided.\nWell, you both went out with the blue balloon,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n12\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nand you took your gun with you, just in case, as\nyou always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a\nvery muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and\nrolled until he was black all over; and then, when\nthe balloon was blown up as big as big, and\nyou and\nPooh were both holding on to the string, you let\ngo suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up\ninto the sky, and stayed there-level with the top of\nthe tree and about twenty feet away from it.\n\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\n\"Isn't that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down\n\"What do I look like?\"\nto\nyou.\n\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\"\nYou said.\n\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"-not like a small\nblack cloud in a blue sky?\"\n\"Not very much.\"\n*Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different.\nAnd, as I say, you never can tell with bees.\"\nThere was no wind to blow him nearer to the\ntree, so there he stayed. He could see the honey, he\ncould smell the honey, but he couldn't quite reach\nthe honey.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nAfter a little while he called down to you.\n\"Christopher Robin!\" he said in a loud whisper.\n\"Hallo!\"\n\"I think the bees suspect something!\"\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n\"I don't know.

You never can tell with bees.\"\nThere was another little silence, and then he called\ndown to you again.\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n“Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\n\"I think so.\"\n13\n\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up\nand down with it, and look up at me every now and\nthen, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.'
