Next to his house\nwas a piece of broken board which had: \"TRES-\nPASSERS W” on it. When Christopher Robin\nasked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his\ngrandfather's name, and had been in the family for\na long time. Christopher Robin said you couldn't\nbe called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you\ncould, because his grandfather was, and it was short\nfor Trespassers Will, which was short of Tres-\npassers William. And his grandfather had had two\nnames in case he lost one-Trespassers after an\nuncle, and William after Trespassers.\n\"I've got two names,\" said Christopher Robin\ncarelessly.\n32\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\nTRESPASSERS\nWH\n\"Well, there you are, that proves it,\" said Piglet.\nOne fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing\naway the snow in front of his house, he happened\nto look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh\nwas walking round and round in a circle, thinking\nDigitized by\n33\nGoogle\n34\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nof something else, and when Piglet called to him, he\njust went on walking.\n\"Hallo!\" said Piglet, \"what are you doing?\"\n\"Hunting,\" said Pooh.\n\"Hunting what?\"\n\"Tracking something,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh very\nmysteriously.\n\"Tracking what?\" said Piglet, coming closer.\n\"That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself,\nWhat?\"\nWhat do you think you'll answer?\"\n\"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\" said\nWinnie-the-Pooh. \"Now, look there.\" He pointed\n10/04.\nMalinska\nto the ground in front of him. \"What do you see\nthere?\"\n\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a\nlittle squeak of excitment. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you\nthink it's a-a-a Woozle?\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nOB\nThe\nFY\n£\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n4.0\nDigitized by\n35\n\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and\nsometimes it isn't.

Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\nstop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled\nsort of way.\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Piglet.\n\"It's a very funny thing,\" said Bear, “but there\nseem to be two animals now. This-whatever-it-was\n-has been joined by another-whatever-it-is-and\nthe two of them are now proceeding in company.\nWould you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case\nthey turn out to be Hostile Animals?\"\nPiglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and\nsaid that he had nothing to do until Friday, and\nwould be delighted to come, in case it really was a\nWoozle.\n\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said\nWinnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he\nhad nothing to do until Friday. So off they went\ntogether.\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just\nhere, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is\nwhat they were, had been going round this spin-\nney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet\nafter them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh\nwhat his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to\nRemove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his\nGrandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n37\nyears from Shortness of Breath, and other matters\nof interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grand-\nfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grand-\nfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he\nwould be allowed to take one home and keep it,\nand what Christopher Robin would say. And still\nthe tracks went on in front of them....\nSuddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed\nexcitedly in front of him. \"Look!\"\n\"What?\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to\nshow that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up\nand down once or twice in an exercising sort of\nway.\n\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. “A third animal has\njoined the other two!”\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n"}
