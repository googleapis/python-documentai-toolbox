Piglet told himself that never in all his life,\nand he was goodness knows how old—three, was it,\nor four?-never had he seen so much rain. Days and\ndays and days.\n\"If only,\" he thought, as he looked out of the\nwindow, \"I had been in Pooh's house, or Christo-\npher Robin's house, or Rabbit's house when it began\nto rain, then I should have had Company all this\ntime, instead of being here all alone, with nothing\nto do except wonder when it will stop.\" And he\nimagined himself with Pooh, saying, \"Did\nyou ever\nsee such rain, Pooh?\" and Pooh saying, “Isn't it\nawful, Piglet?\" and Piglet saying, \"I wonder how\nit is over Christopher Robin's way\" and Pooh say-\ning, \"I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded\nout by this time.\" It would have been jolly to talk\n128\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nSURROUNDED BY WATER\n129\nlike this, and really, it wasn't much good having\nanything exciting like floods, if you couldn't share\nthem with somebody.\nFor it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches\nin which Piglet had nosed about so often had be-\ncome streams, the little streams across which he had\nsplashed were rivers, and the river, between whose\nsteep banks they had played so happily, had sprawled\nout of its own bed and was taking up so much room\neverywhere, that Piglet was beginning.to wonder\nwhether it would be coming into his bed soon.\n\"It's a little Anxious,” he said to himself, “to be a\nVery Small Animal Entirely Surrounded by Water.\nChristopher Robin and Pooh could escape by Climb-\ning Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping,\nand Rabbit could escape by Burrowing, and Owl\ncould escape by Flying, and Eeyore could escape\nby-by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and\nhere am I, surrounded by water and I can't do\nanything.\"\nIt went on raining, and every day the water got •\na little higher, until now it was nearly up to Piglet's\nwindow. and still he hadn't done anything.\n\"There's Pooh,\" he thought to himself. \"Pooh\nhasn't much Brain, but he never comes to any harm.\nHe does silly things and they turn out right.

And then there's Eeyore. And\nEeyore is so miserable anyhow that he wouldn't\nmind about this. But I wonder what Christopher\nRobin would do?\"\nThen suddenly he remembered a story which\nChristopher Robin had told him about a man on a\ndesert island who had written something in a bottle\nand thrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if\nhe wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the\nwater, perhaps somebody would come and rescue\nbim!\nHe left the window and began to search his\nhouse, all of it that wasn't under water, and at last\nhe found a pencil and a small piece of dry paper,\nand a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one\nside of the paper:\nHELP!\nPIGLET (ME)\nand on the other side:\nIT'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n132\nThen he put the paper in the bottle, and he\ncorked the bottle up as tightly as he could, and he\nleant out of his window as far as he could lean\nwithout falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as\nhe could throw-splash!-and in a little while it\nbobbed up again on the water; and he watched it\nfloating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes\nached with looking, and sometimes he thought it\nwas the bottle, and sometimes he thought it was just\na ripple on the water which he was following, and\nthen suddenly he knew that he would never see it\nagain and that he had done all that he could do to\nsave himself.\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"So now,\" he thought, \"somebody else will have\nto do something, and I hope they will do it soon,\nbecause if they don't I shall have to swim, which I\ncan't, so I hope they do it soon.\" And then he gave\na very long sigh and said, \"I wish Pooh were here.\nIt's so much more friendly with two.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n1\nI\nT\nSURROUNDED BY WATER\n133\nWhen the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained,\nand it rained, and it rained, and he slept and he\nslept and he slept. He had had a tiring day. You re-\nmember how he discovered the North Pole; well,\nhe was so proud of this that he asked Christopher\nRobin if there were any other Poles such as a Bear\nof Little Brain might discover.\n\"There's a South Pole,\" said Christopher Robin,\n\"and I expect there's an East Pole and a West Pole,\nthough people don't like talking about them.\"\nPooh was very excited when he heard this, and\nsuggested that they should have an Expotition to\ndiscover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had\nthought of something else to do with Kanga; so\nPooh went out to discover the East Pole by himself.\nWhether he discovered it or not, I forget; but he\nwas so tired when he got home that, in the very\nmiddle of his supper, after he had been eating for\nlittle more than half-an-hour, he fell fast asleep in\nhis chair, and slept and slept and slept.\nThen suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the\nEast Pole, and it was a very cold pole with the\ncoldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had\nfound a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room\nfor his legs, so he had left them outside.
