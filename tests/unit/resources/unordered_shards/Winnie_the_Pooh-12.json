I ask myself,\nWhat?\"\nWhat do you think you'll answer?\"\n\"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\" said\nWinnie-the-Pooh. \"Now, look there.\" He pointed\n10/04.\nMalinska\nto the ground in front of him. \"What do you see\nthere?\"\n\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a\nlittle squeak of excitment. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you\nthink it's a-a-a Woozle?\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nOB\nThe\nFY\n£\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n4.0\nDigitized by\n35\n\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and\nsometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-\nmarks.\"\nGoogle\ntale\n36\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nWith these few words he went on tracking, and\nPiglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran\nafter him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\nstop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled\nsort of way.\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Piglet.\n\"It's a very funny thing,\" said Bear, “but there\nseem to be two animals now. This-whatever-it-was\n-has been joined by another-whatever-it-is-and\nthe two of them are now proceeding in company.\nWould you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case\nthey turn out to be Hostile Animals?\"\nPiglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and\nsaid that he had nothing to do until Friday, and\nwould be delighted to come, in case it really was a\nWoozle.\n\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said\nWinnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he\nhad nothing to do until Friday. So off they went\ntogether.\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just\nhere, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is\nwhat they were, had been going round this spin-\nney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet\nafter them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh\nwhat his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to\nRemove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his\nGrandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n37\nyears from Shortness of Breath, and other matters\nof interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grand-\nfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grand-\nfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he\nwould be allowed to take one home and keep it,\nand what Christopher Robin would say. And still\nthe tracks went on in front of them....\nSuddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed\nexcitedly in front of him. \"Look!\"\n\"What?\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to\nshow that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up\nand down once or twice in an exercising sort of\nway.\n\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. “A third animal has\njoined the other two!”\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"Pooh!\" cried Piglet. \"Do you think it is another\nWoozle?\"\n38\n\"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks.\nIt is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be,\nWizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one,\nif so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.'\nSo they went on, feeling just a little anxious now,\nin case the three animals in front of them were of\nHostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that\nhis Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of else-\nwhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if\nthey met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite ac-\ncidentally, and only because he liked Christopher\nRobin so much. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-\nthe-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his\nnose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\nhot and anxious than ever in his life before. There\nwere four animals in front of them!\n\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n39\nas it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. An-\nother Woozle has joined them!”\nAnd so it seemed to be. There were the tracks;\ncrossing over each other here, getting muddled up\nwith each other there; but, quite plainly every now\nand then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\n\"I think,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip\nof his nose too, and found that it brought very little\ncomfort, \"I think that I have just remembered\nsomething. I have just remembered something that\nI forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-\nmorrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and\ndo it now.'\n\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with\nyou,\" said Pooh.\n\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the after-\nnoon,” said Piglet quickly. “It's a very particular\nmorning thing, that has to be done in the morning,\nand, if possible, between the hours of What\nwould you say the time was?\"\n\"About twelve,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at\nthe sun.\n\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and\ntwelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you'll ex-\ncuse me- What's that?\"\nPooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard\nthe whistle again, he looked up into the branches of\na big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n40\n\"It's Christopher Robin,\" he said.\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nDigitized by\nMart\nAM\n\"Ah, then you'll be all right,\" said Piglet. \"You'll\nbe quite safe with him. Good-bye,\" and he trotted\noff home as quickly as he could, very glad to be\nOut of All Danger again.\nGoogle\n13\nWATER\nChristopher Robin came slowly down his tree.\n\"Silly old Bear,\" he said, \"what were you doing?\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n41\nFirst you went round the spinney twice by your-\nself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went\nround again together, and then you were just going\nround a fourth time--\"\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding\nup his paw.\nHe sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful\nway he could think. Then he fitted his paw into\none of the Tracks . . . and then he scratched his\nnose twice, and stood up.\n\"Yes,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\"I see now,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\" said he, \"and\nI am a Bear of No Brain at All.\"\n\"You're the Best Bear in All the World,” said\nChristopher Robin soothingly.\n\"Am I?\" said Pooh hopefully.
