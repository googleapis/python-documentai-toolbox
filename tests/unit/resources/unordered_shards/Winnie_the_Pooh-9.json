But as he got\nnearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed\nhoney, and his tongue came out and began to pol-\nish up his mouth, ready for it.\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the\njar. \"A Heffalump has been eating it!\" And then he\nthought a little and said, \"Oh, no, I did. I forgot.\"\nIndeed, he had eaten most\nof it. But there was a little left\nat the very bottom of the jar,\nand he pushed his head right\nin, and began to lick. ...\nBy and by Piglet woke up.\nAs soon as he woke he said to\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n65\nhimself, \"Oh!\" Then he said bravely, \"Yes,\" and\nthen, still more bravely, \"Quite so.\" But he didn't\nfeel very brave, for the word which was really jig-\ngeting about in his brain was \"Heffalumps.\"\nWhat was a Heffalump like?\nWas it Fierce?\nDid it come when you whistled? And how did it\ncome?\nWas it Fond of Pigs at all?\nIf it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference\nwhat sort of Pig?\nSupposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make\nany difference if the Pig had a grandfather called\nTRESPASSERS WILLIAM?\n1.4\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n66\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nHe didn't know the answer to any of these ques-\ntions... and he was going\nto see his first Heffalump in\nabout an hour from now!\nOf course Pooh would be\nwith him, and it was much\nmore Friendly with two. But\nsuppose Heffalumps were\nVery Fierce with Pigs and\nBears? Wouldn't it be better\nto pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go\nup to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then sup-\npose that it was a very fine day, and there was no\nHeffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all\nthe morning, simply wasting his time for nothing.\nWhat should he do?\nAnd then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up\nvery quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very\ncautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a\nHeffalump there. And if there was, he would go\nback to bed, and if there\nwasn't, he wouldn't.\nSo off he went. At first he\nthought that there wouldn't\nbe a Heffalump in the Trap,\nand then he thought that\nthere would, and as he got\nnearer he was sure that there\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n67\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\nwould, because he could hear it heffalumping about\nit like anything.\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\" said Piglet to him-\nself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow,\nhaving got so near, he felt that he must just see\nwhat a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side\nof the Trap and looked in. . . .\nAnd all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been try-\ning to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he\nshook it, the more tightly it stuck. “Bother!” he\nsaid, inside the jar, and “Oh, help!\" and, mostly\n\"Ow!\" And he tried bumping it against things, but\nas he couldn't see what he was bumping it against,\nit didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the\nTrap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not\nmuch of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he\nlifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud,\nroaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and it was\nat that moment that Piglet looked down.\n\"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump, a Hor-\nrible Heffalump!\" and he scampered off as hard as\nhe could, still crying out, “Help, help, a Herrible\nHoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump!\nHoll, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!\" And he didn't\nstop crying and scampering until he got to Chris-\ntopher Robin's house.\n\"Whatever's the matter, Piglet?\" said Christoper\nRobin, who was just getting up.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n68\n\"Heff,\" said Piglet, breath-\ning so hard that he could\nhardly speak, \"a Hell-a Heff\n-a Heffalump.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Up there,\" said Piglet,\nwaving his paw.\n\"What did it look like?\"\n\"Like-like-- It had the\nmyday\nbiggest head you ever saw,\nChristopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like-\nlike nothing. A huge big-well, like a-I don't know\n-like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.”\n\"Well,\" said Christopher Robin, putting on his\nshoes, \"I shall go and look at it. Come on.'\nPiglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin\nwith him, so off they went....\n\"I can hear it, can't you?\" said Piglet anxiously, as\nthey got near.\n\"I can hear something,\" said Christopher Robin.\nANSA\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nIt was Pooh bumping his\nhead against a tree-root he\nhad found.\n\"There!\" said Piglet. \"Isn't\nit awful?\" And he held on\ntight to Christopher Robin's\nhand.\nSuddenly Christopher\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n69\nRobin began to laugh . . . and he laughed . . . and\nhe laughed... and he laughed. And while he was\nstill laughing-Crash went the Heffalump's head\nagainst the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out\ncame Pooh's head again..\nThen Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had\nbeen, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran\nstraight off home and went to bed with a headache.\nBut Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to\nbreakfast together.\n\"Oh, Bear!\" said Christopher Robin. \"How I do\nlove you!\"\n\"So do I,\" said Pooh.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nIN WHICH Eeyore Has a Birthday and\nGets Two Presents\nCHAPTER VI\nERVORE\nJEYORE, the old grey Donkey,\nstood by the side of the stream, and looked at him-\nself in the water.\n\"Pathetic,\" he said. \"That's what it is.

Then he looked at\nhimself in the water again.\n\"As I thought,\" he said. \"No better from this side.\nBut nobody minds. Nobody cares.
