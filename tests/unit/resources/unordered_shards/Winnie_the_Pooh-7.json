And Kanga wouldn't discover the difference\nuntil Afterwards.\nWell, Rabbit read this out proudly, and for a\nlittle while after he had read it nobody said any-\nthing. And then Piglet, who had been opening and\nshutting his mouth without making any noise, man-\naged to say very huskily:\n\"And-Afterwards?\"\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\"When Kanga does Discover the Difference?\"\n\"Then we all say 'Aha!”\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\n\"All three of us?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"Why, what's the trouble, Piglet?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said Piglet, “as long as we all three say\nit. As long as we all three say it,” said Piglet, “I\ndon't mind,\" he said, \"but I shouldn't care to say\n‘Aha!' by myself. It wouldn't sound nearly so well.\nBy the way,\" he said, \"you are quite sure about\nwhat you said about the winter months?\"\n\"The winter months?\"\n\"Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months.\"\n\"Oh, yes, yes, that's all right.

Now come\nalong.\"\nSo they all went out to look for Kanga.\nKanga and Roo were spending a quiet afternoon\nin a sandy part of the Forest. Baby Roo was prac-\ntising very small jumps in the sand, and falling\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n96\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\ndown mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and\nKanga was fidgeting about and saying, “Just one\nmore jump, dear, and then we must go home.\" And\nat that moment who should come stumping up the\nhill but Pooh.\n\"Good afternoon, Kanga.\"\n\"Good afternoon, Pooh.\"\n\"Look at me jumping,\" squeaked Roo, and fell\ninto another mouse-hole.\nLands\n\"Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!\"\n\"We were just going home,\" said Kanga. \"Good\nafternoon, Rabbit. Good afternoon, Piglet.\"\nRabbit and Piglet, who had now come up from\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\nthe other side of the hill, said, \"Good afternoon,\"\nand “Hallo, Roo,\" and Roo asked them to look at\nhim jumping, so they stayed and looked.\nAnd Kanga looked too. . . .\n\"Oh, Kanga,\" said Pooh, after Rabbit had winked\nat him twice, \"I don't know if you are interested in\nPoetry at all?\"\n\"Hardly at all,\" said Kanga.\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n\"Roo, dear, just one more jump and then we must\ngo home.\"\nThere was a short silence while Roo fell down\nanother mouse-hole.\n\"Go on,” said Rabbit in a loud whisper behind his\npaw.\n\"Talking of Poetry,\" said Pooh, \"I made up a little\npiece as I was coming along.

That's how it is.\"\nBut there were moments when Piglet wished that\nKanga couldn't. Often, when he had had a long\nwalk home through the Forest, he had wished that\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\nIOI\nhe were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to him-\nself at the bottom of Kanga's pocket,\nthis\ntake\n\"If\nis\nshall\nC\nreally\nflying I\nnever\nAnd as he went up in the air, he said, \"Ooooooo!\"\n1111\nto\nDigitized by\nand as he came down he said, “Ow!” And he was\nsaying, \"Oooo00o-ow, Oooo00o-ow, Ooooooo-ow\"\nall the way to Kanga's house.\nOf course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her\npocket, she saw what had happened. Just for a mo-\nment, she thought she was frightened, and then she\nknew she wasn't; for she felt quite sure that Chris-\ntopher Robin would never let any harm happen to\nRoo. So she said to herself, \"If they are having a\njoke with me, I will have a joke with them.\"\nGoogle\nit.\"\n(02\n\"Now then, Roo, dear,” she said, as she took Pig-\nlet out of her pocket. “Bed-time.”\n“Aha!” said Piglet, as well as he could after his\nTerrifying Journey.

But the others weren't there. Rabbit\nwas playing with Baby Roo in his own house, and\nfeeling more fond of him every minute, and Pooh,\nwho had decided to be a Kanga, was still at the\nsandy place on the top of the Forest, practising\njumps.\n\"I am not at all sure,\" said Kanga in a thoughtful\nvoice, \"that it wouldn't be a good idea to have a\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\n103\ncold bath this evening.
