Ah!\" Then he went to call upon\nhis friend Piglet to see what he thought about it.\nAnd at Piglet's house he found Rabbit. So they all\ntalked about it together.\n\"What I don't like about it is this,” said Rabbit.\n\"Here are we-you, Pooh, and you, Piglet, and Me\n-and suddenly-_\"\n\"And Eeyore,\" said Pooh.\n\"And Eeyore-and then suddenly”\n\"And Owl,\" said Pooh.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nľ\n3\n:\n;\n}\nJ\n}\n:\nI b\nDigitized by Google\n90\n\"And Owl-and then all of a sudden-\n\"Oh, and Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"I was forgetting\nhim.\"\n\"Here-we-are,\" said Rabbit very slowly and\ncarefully, “all-of-us, and then, suddenly, we wake\nup one morning and, what do we find?

The\nbest way would be to steal Baby Roo and hide him,\nand then when Kanga says, 'Where's Baby Roo?\"\n'Aba!'\"'\nwe say,\n\"Aha!\" said Pooh, practising. \"Aha! Aha! . . . Of\ncourse,\" he went on, \"we could say 'Aha!' even if\nwe hadn't stolen Baby Roo.\"\n\"Pooh,\" said Rabbit kindly, \"you haven't any\nbrain.\"\n\"I know,\" said Pooh humbly.\n“We say ‘Aha! so that Kanga knows that we\nknow where Baby Roo is. ‘Aha!” means ‘We'll tell\nyou where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go away\nfrom the Forest and never come back.' Now don't\ntalk while I think.”\nPooh went into a corner and tried saying 'Aha!'\nin that sort of voice. Sometimes it seemed to him\nthat it did mean what Rabbit said, and sometimes it\nseemed to him that it didn't. \"I suppose it's just\npractice,\" he thought. \"I wonder if Kanga will have\nto practise too so as to understand it.”\n\"There's just one thing,\" said Piglet, fidgeting a\nbit. \"I was talking to Christopher Robin, and he\nsaid that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as One\nof the Fiercer Animals. I am not frightened of\nFierce Animals in the ordinary way, but it is well\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n92\nknown that, if One of the Fiercer Animals is De-\nprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of\nthe Fiercer Animals. In which case 'Aha! is perhaps\na foolish thing to say.\"\n\"Piglet,\" said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and lick-\ning the end of it, \"you haven't any pluck.\"\n\"It is hard to be brave,\" said Piglet, sniffing slightly,\n“when you're only a Very Small Animal.'\nRabbit, who had begun to write very busily,\nlooked up and said:\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"It is because you are a very small animal that you\nwill be Useful in the adventure before us.\"\nPiglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful\nthat he forgot to be frightened any more, and when\nRabbit went on to say that Kangas were only Fierce\nduring the winter months, being at other times of\nan Affectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit\nstill, he was so eager to begin being useful at once.\n\"What about me?\" said Pooh sadly. \"I suppose I\n“I\nshan't be useful?\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n•\nKANGA AND BABY ROO\n\"Never mind, Pooh,\" said Piglet comfortingly.\n\"Another time perhaps.\"\n\"Without Pooh,\" said Rabbit solemnly as he sharp-\nened his pencil, \"the adventure would be impos-\nsible.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Piglet, and tried not to look disap-\npointed. But Pooh went into a corner of the room\nand said proudly to himself, \"Impossible without\nMe!
