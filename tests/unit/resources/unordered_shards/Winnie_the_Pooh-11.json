Little soft clouds played happily in a\nblue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the\nsun as if they had come to put it out, and then slid-\ning away suddenly so that the next might have his\nturn. Through them and between them the sun\nshone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now be-\nside the new green lace which the beeches had put\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n46\non so prettily. Through copse and spinney marched\nBear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over\nrocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone\ninto the heather again; and so at last, tired and hun-\ngry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\n\"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\"\nsaid Bear to himself, \"it's Owl who knows some-\nthing about something,\" he said, “or my name's not\nWinnie-the-Pooh,” he said. “Which it is,” he added.\n\"So there\nyou are.\nOwl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world resi-\ndence of great charm, which was grander than any-\nbody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had\nboth a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the\nknocker there was a notice which said:\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nPLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.\nUnderneath the bell-pull there was a notice which\nsaid:\nPLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.\nThese notices had been written by Christopher\nRobin, who was the only one in the forest who\ncould spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many\nways, able to read and write and spell his own name\nWOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate\nwords like MEASLES and BUTTERED TOAST.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n1₁\n30\nPLES RING\nLAN RESER\nIS REDIRD\nPLES CHOKER\nAN RNSR\n13 NOT REDID\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n48\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nWinnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very care-\nfully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case\nhe had missed some of it, from right to left. Then,\nto make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the\nknocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope,\nand he called out in a very loud voice, “Owl! I re-\nquire an answer! It's Bear speaking.\" And the door\nopened, and Owl looked out.\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore,\nwho is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's\nMoping about it. So could you very kindly tell me\nhow to find it for him?\"\n\"Well,\" said Owl, \"the customary procedure in\nsuch cases is as follows.\"\n\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?” said\nPooh. \"For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and\nlong words, Bother me.\"\n\"It means the Thing to Do.\"\n\"As long as it means that, I don't mind,\" said Pooh\nhumbly.\n\"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Re-\nward. Then--\"\n\"Just a moment,\" said Pooh, holding up his paw.\n“What do we do to this-what you were saying?\nYou sneezed just as you were going to tell me.\"\n\"I didn't sneeze.\"\n\"Yes, you did, Owl.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEEYORE LOSES A TAIL\n49\n\"Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze with-\nout knowing it.'\n\"Well, you can't know it without something hav-\ning been sneezed.\"\n\"What I said was, 'First Issue a Reward'.\"\n\"You're doing it again,\" said Pooh sadly.\n\"A Reward!\" said Owl very loudly. \"We write a\nnotice to say that we will give a large something to\nanybody who finds Eeyore's tail.\"\n“I see, I see,” said Pooh, nodding his head. \"Talk-\ning about large somethings,\" he went on dreamily,\n\"I generally have a small something about now-\nabout this time in the morning,\" and he looked\nwistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl's\nparlour; \"just a mouthful of condensed milk or\nwhatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey-_'\n\"Well, then,\" said Owl, \"we write out this notice,\nand we put it up all over the forest.\"\n\"A lick of honey,\" murmured Bear to himself, \"or\n-or not, as the case may be.\" And he gave a deep\nsigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was\nsaying.\nBut Owl went on and on, using longer and longer\nwords, until at last he came back to where he\nstarted, and he explained that the person to write\nout this notice was Christopher Robin.\n\"It was he who wrote the ones on my front door\nfor me. Did you see them, Pooh?\"\nDigitized by\n99\nGoogle\n50\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nFor some time now Pooh had been saying \"Yes\"\nand \"No\" in turn, with his eyes shut, to all that\nOwl was saying, and having said, “Yes, yes,” last\ntime, he said \"No, not at all,\" now, without really\nknowing what Owl was talking about.\nXX\n3\n9\n\"Didn't you see them?\" said Owl, a little surprised.\n\"Come and look at them now.\"\nSo they went outside. And Pooh looked at the\nknocker and the notice below it, and he looked at\nthe bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more\nhe looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he\nhad seen something like it, somewhere else, some-\ntime before.\n\"Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?\" said Owl.\nPooh nodded.\n\"It reminds me of something,\" he said, \"but I can't\nthink what.
