The fact was Piglet was\nwishing that he had thought about it first.\n\"I shall do it,\" said Pooh, after waiting a little\nlonger, \"by means of a trap. And it must be a Cun-\nning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.\"\n\"Pooh,\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now,\n\"I will.\" And then he said, “How shall we do it?\"\nand Pooh said, “That's just it. How?\" And then\nthey sat down together to think it out.\nPooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very\nDeep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come\nalong and fall into the Pit, and-\n——\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"Why?\" said Piglet.\n\"Why what?\" said Pooh.\n\"Why would he fall in?\"\nPooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that\nthe Heffalump might be walking along, humming a\nlittle song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if\nit would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very\nDeep Pit until he was half-way down, when it\nwould be too late.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n1\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n57\nPiglet said that this was a very good Trap, but\nsupposing it were raining already?\nPooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he\nhadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up,\nand said that, if it were raining already, the Heffa-\nlump would be looking at the sky wondering if it\nwould clear up, and so he wouldn't see the Very\nDeep Pit until he was half-way down. . . . When it\nwould be too late.\nPiglet said that, now that this point had been ex-\nplained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap.\nPooh was very proud when he heard this, and he\nfelt that the Heffalump was as good as caught al-\nready, but there was just one other thing which\nhad to be thought about, and it was this. Where\nshould they dig the Very Deep Pit?\nPiglet said that the best place would be some-\nwhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell\ninto it, only about a foot farther on.\n\"But then he would see us digging it,\" said Pooh.\n\"Not if he was looking at the sky.\"\n\"He would Suspect,\" said Pooh, \"if he happened\nto look down.\" He thought for a long time and\nthen added sadly, \"It isn't as easy as I thought. I\nsuppose that's why Heffalumps hardly ever get\ncaught.\"\n\"That must be it,\" said Piglet.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n58\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nThey sighed and got up; and when they had\ntaken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they\nsat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying\nto himself, \"If only I could think of something!\"\nFor he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could\ncatch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way\nto go about it.\n\"Suppose,\" he said to Piglet, “you wanted to catch\nme, how would you do it?\"\n\"Well,\" said Piglet, \"I should do it like this. I\nshould make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of\nHoney in the Trap, and you would smell it, and\nyou would go in after it, and——”\n\"And I would go in after it,\" said Pooh excitedly,\n\"only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and\nI would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick\nround the edges first of all, pretending that there\nwasn't any more, you know, and then I should\nwalk away and think about it a little, and then I\nshould come back and start licking in the middle of\nthe jar, and then——”\n\"Yes, well never mind about that. There you would\nbe, and there I should catch you. Now the first\nthing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I\nshould think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot\nof- I say, wake up, Pooh!\"\nPooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke\nup with a start, and said that Honey was a much\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n59\nmore trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't\nthink so; and they were just going to argue about\nit, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns\nin the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but\nif they put honey, then Pooh would have to give\nup some of his own honey, so he said, \"All right,\nhoney then,\" just as Pooh remembered it too, and\nwas going to say, \"All right, haycorns.\"\n\"Honey,\" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful\nway, as if it were now settled. \"I'll dig the pit,\nwhile you go and get the honey.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.\nHUN\nAs soon as he got home, he went to the larder;\nand he stood on a chair, and took down a very large\njar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n60\nwa fe\nwritten on it, but, just to\nmake sure, he took off the\npaper cover and looked at it,\nand it looked just like honey.\n\"But you never can tell,\"\nsaid Pooh. \"I remember my\nuncle saying once that he\nhad seen cheese just this col-\nour.\" So he put his tongue in,\nand took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is. No\ndoubt about that. And honey, I should say, right\ndown to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,'\nhe said, \"somebody put cheese in at the bottom just\nfor a joke. Perhaps I had better go a little further\n.. just in case . . . in case Heffalumps don't like\ncheese... same as me. . . . Ah!\" And he gave a\ndeep sigh. \"I was right. It is honey, right the way\ndown.\"\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nHaving made certain of this, he took the jar back\nto Piglet, and Piglet looked\nup from the bottom of his\nVery Deep Pit, and said,\n\"Got it?\" and Pooh said,\n\"Yes, but it isn't quite a full\njar,\" and he threw it down\nto Piglet, and Piglet said,\n\"No, it isn't! Is that all\nyou've got left?\" and Pooh\n144,7\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n61\nsaid \"Yes.\" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at\nthe bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they\nwent off home together.\n\"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they\nhad got to Pooh's house. \"And we meet at six o'clock\ntomorrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how\nmany Heffalumps we've got in our Trap.\"\n\"Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\"\n\"No. Why do you want string?\"\n\"To lead them home with.\"\n\"Oh! ... I think Heffalumps come if you whistle.\"\n\"Some do and some don't. You never can tell with\nHeffalumps. Well, good night!\"\n\"Good night!\"\nAnd off Piglet trotted to his house TRES-\nPASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations\nfor bed.\nSome hours later, just as the night was beginning\nto steal away, Pooh woke up suddenly with a sink-\ning feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before,\nand he knew what it meant. He was hungry. So he\nwent to the larder, and he stood on a chair and\nreached up to the top shelf, and found-nothing.\n\"That's funny,\" he thought. “I know I had a jar\nof honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to\ntop, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that\nI should know it was honey. That's very funny.\"\nAnd then he began to wander up and down, won-\nthe top,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n62\ndering where it was and murmuring a murmur to\nhimself. Like this:\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nIt's very, very funny,\n'Cos I know I had some honey;\n'Cos it had a label on,\nSaying HUNNY.\nA goloptious full-up pot too,\nAnd I don't know where it's got to,\nNo, I don't know where it's gone-\nWell, it's funny.\nHe had murmured this to himself three times in\na singing sort of way, when suddenly he remem-\nbered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to\ncatch the Heffalump.\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"It all comes of trying to be\nkind to Heffalumps.\" And he got back into bed.\nBut he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep,\nthe more he couldn't. He tried Counting Sheep,\nwhich is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep,\nand, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffa-\nlumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffa-\nlump that he counted was making straight for a pot\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\nof Pooh's honey, and eating it all. For some min-\nutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hun-\ndred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its\njaws, and saying to itself, \"Very good honey this,\nI don't know when I've tasted better,\" Pooh could\nbear it no longer. He jumped out of bed, he ran out\nof the house, and he ran straight to the Six Pine\nTrees.\n63\nThe Sun was still in bed, but there was a light-\nness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood\nwhich seemed to show that it was waking up and\nwould soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-\nLight the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the\nVery Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n"}
