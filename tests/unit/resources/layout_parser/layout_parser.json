It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, \"But I thought he was a boy?\" \"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\"Then you can't call him Winnie?\"6. \"I don't.\"\"But you said-\"\"He's Winnje-ther-Pooh.

This evening--\"What about a story?\" said Christopher Robin. \"What about a story?\" I said.\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?\"\"I suppose I could,\" I said. \"What sort of stories does he like?\"\"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.\" \"Oh, I see.\"\"So could you very sweetly?\"\"I'll try,\" I said.So I triedOnce upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders.(\"What does 'under the name mean?\" asked Christopher Robin.\"It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it.\"Digitized by GoogleWE ARE INTRODUCEDARNIG ALSOAB SAUDERZ\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,\" said Chris- topher Robin.\u201cNow I am,\u201d said a growly voice.\"Then I will go on,\" said I.)One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think.Digitized by Google4*WINNIE-THE-POOHFirst of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing- noise means something. You don't get a buzzing- noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.\"Then he thought another long time, and said: \"And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.\"And then he got up, and said: \"And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.\" So he began to climb the tree.Digitized by Google\n\n## WE ARE INTRODUCED\n\nHeclimbedandheclimbedandheclimbed,\u0995andasheclimbedhesang57Isn't it funnyalittlesongtohimself.Itwentlike this:How a bear likes honey?

By that time he had thought of another song.It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees. And that being so (if the Bees were Bears), We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complain- ing Song.

You hadDigitized by GoogleWE ARE INTRODUCEDhad a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's rela- tions had had a big blue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you.\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh. He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.\"It's like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now, if you have a green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and not notice you, and if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is: Which is most likely?\"\"Wouldn't they notice you underneath the bal- loon?\" you asked.\"They might or they might not,\" said Winnie- the-Pooh. \"You never can tell with bees.\" He thought for a moment and said: \"I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That will deceive them.\"Then you had better have the blue balloon,\" you said; and so it was decided. Well, you both went out with the blue balloon,Digitized by Google12and you took your gun with you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of, and rolled androlled until he was black all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big, and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed there-level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it.\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\"Isn't that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you. \"What do I look like?\"\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\" you said.\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"-not like a small black cloud in a blue sky?\"\"Not very much.\"\"Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different.
