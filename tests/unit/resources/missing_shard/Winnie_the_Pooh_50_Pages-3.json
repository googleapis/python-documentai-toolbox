You had\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nII\nhad a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's rela-\ntions had had a big blue one, and had left it behind,\nbeing really too young to go to a party at all; and\nso you had brought the green one and the blue one\nhome with you.\n\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh.\nHe put his head between his paws and thought\nvery carefully.\n\"It's like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey\nwith a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees\nknow you're coming. Now, if you have a green\nballoon, they might think you were only part of\nthe tree, and not notice you, and if you have a blue\nballoon, they might think you were only part of\nthe sky, and not notice you, and the question is:\nWhich is most likely?\"\n\"Wouldn't they notice you underneath the bal-\nloon?\"\nyou asked.\n\"They might or they might not,\" said Winnie-\nthe-Pooh. \"You never can tell with bees.\" He\nthought for a moment and said: \"I shall try to look\nlike a small black cloud. That will deceive them.\"\nThen you had better have the blue balloon,\" you\nsaid; and so it was decided.\nWell, you both went out with the blue balloon,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n12\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nand you took your gun with you, just in case, as\nyou always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a\nvery muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and\nrolled until he was black all over; and then, when\nthe balloon was blown up as big as big, and\nyou and\nPooh were both holding on to the string, you let\ngo suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up\ninto the sky, and stayed there-level with the top of\nthe tree and about twenty feet away from it.\n\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\n\"Isn't that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down\n\"What do I look like?\"\nto\nyou.\n\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\"\nYou said.\n\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"-not like a small\nblack cloud in a blue sky?\"\n\"Not very much.\"\n*Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different.\nAnd, as I say, you never can tell with bees.\"\nThere was no wind to blow him nearer to the\ntree, so there he stayed. He could see the honey, he\ncould smell the honey, but he couldn't quite reach\nthe honey.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\nAfter a little while he called down to you.\n\"Christopher Robin!\" he said in a loud whisper.\n\"Hallo!\"\n\"I think the bees suspect something!\"\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n\"I don't know. But something tells me that they're\nsuspicious!\"\n\"Perhaps they think that you're after their honey.\"\n\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\"\nThere was another little silence, and then he called\ndown to you again.\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n“Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\n\"I think so.\"\n13\n\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up\nand down with it, and look up at me every now and\nthen, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.' I think, if\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n14\nyou did that, it would help the deception which we\nare practising on these bees.\"\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nWell, you laughed to yourself, \"Silly old Bear!\"\nbut didn't say\nyou\nit aloud because you were so\nfond of him, and you went home for your umbrella.\n\"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-\nPooh, as soon as you got back to the tree. \"I was\nbeginning to get anxious. I have discovered that the\nbees are now definitely Suspicious.\"\n\"Shall I put my umbrella up?\" you said.\n\"Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical.\nThe important bee to deceive is the Queen Bee.\nCan you see which is the Queen Bee from down\nthere?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down\nwith your umbrella, saying, 'Tut-tut, it looks like\nrain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud\nSong, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!\"\nSo, while you walked up and down and wondered\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nWE ARE INTRODUCED\n15\nif it would rain, Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song:\nHow sweet to be a Cloud\nFloating in the Blue!\nEvery little cloud\nAlways sings aloud.\n\"How sweet to be a Cloud\nFloating in the Blue!\"\nIt makes him very proud\nTo be a little cloud.\nThe bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as\never. Some of them, indeed, left their nest and flew\nall round the cloud as it began the second verse of\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n16\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nthis song, and one bee sat down on the nose of the\ncloud for a moment, and then got up again.\n\"Christopher-ow!-Robin,\"\ncalled out the cloud.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I have just been thinking, and I have come to a\nvery important decision. These are the wrong sort\nof bees.\"\n\"Are they?\"\n\"Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they\nwould make the wrong sort of honey, shouldn't\nyou?\"\n\"Would they?\"\n\"Yes. So I think I shall come down.\"\n\"How?\" asked you.\nlet\nWinnie-the-Pooh hadn't thought about this. If he\ngo of the string, he would fall-bump-and he\ndidn't like the idea of that.
