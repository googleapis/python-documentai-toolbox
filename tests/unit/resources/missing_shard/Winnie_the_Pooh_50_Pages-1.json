He had made up a little hum\nthat very morning, as he\nwas doing his Stoutness Ex-\nercises in front of the glass:\nTra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he.\nstretched up as high as he\ncould go, and then Tra-\nla-la, tra-la-oh, help!-la,\nas he tried to reach his toes.\nAfter breakfast he had said\nit over and over to himself until he had learnt it off\nby heart, and now he was humming it right through.\nproperly. It went like this:\n20\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n25\ne\nPOOH GOES VISITING\nTra-la-la, tra-la-la,\nTra-la-la, tra-la-la,\nRum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.\nTiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\nTiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\nRum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n21\nWINNIE-THE-POOR\nWell, he was humming this hum to himself, and\nwalking along gaily, wondering what everybody\nelse was doing, and what it felt like, being some-\nbody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank,\nand in the bank was a large hole.\n\"Aha!\" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) \"If\nI know anything about anything, that hole means\nRabbit,\" he said, \"and Rabbit means Company,\" he\nsaid, “and Company means Food and Listening-to\nMe-Humming and such like. Rum-tum-tum-\ntiddle-um.\"\n22\nSo he bent down, put his head into the hole, and\ncalled out:\n\"Is anybody at home?”\nThere was a sudden scuffling noise from inside\nthe hole, and then silence.\n\"What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?”” called\nout Pooh very loudly.\n\"No!\" said a voice; and then added, \"You needn't\nshout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time.\"\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"Isn't there anybody here at\nall?\"\n\"Nobody.\"\nWinnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole,\nand thought for a little, and he thought to himself,\n\"There must be somebody there, because somebody\nmust have said 'Nobody.'\" So he put his head back\nin the hole, and said:\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH GOES VISITING\n\"Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?\"\n\"No,\" said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this\ntime.\n\"But isn't that Rabbit's voice?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Rabbit. \"It isn't meant\nto be.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\nHe took his head out of the hole, and had another\nthink, and then he put it back, and said:\n\"Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rab-\nbit is?\"\n\"He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is\na great friend of his.\"\n\"But this is Me!\" said Bear, very much surprised.\n\"What sort of Me?\"\n\"Pooh Bear.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" said Rabbit, still more surprised,\n\"Quite, quite sure,\" said Pooh.\n\"Oh, well, then, come in.\"\nCOBDE\n23\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n24\nSo Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way\nthrough the hole, and at last he got in.\n\"You were quite right,\" said Rabbit, looking at\nhim all over. \"It is you. Glad to see you.\"\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"Who did you think it was?”\n\"Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the\nForest. One can't have anybody coming into one's\nhouse. One has to be careful. What about a mouth-\nful of something?\"\nPooh always liked a little something at eleven\no'clock in the morning, and he was very glad to see\nRabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and when\nRabbit said, \"Honey or condensed milk with your\nbread?\" he was so excited that he said, \"Both,\" and\nthen, so as not to seem greedy, he added, “But don't\nbother about the bread, please.\" And for a long\ntime after that he said nothing until at last,\nhumming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got\nup, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that\nhe must be going on.\n● ●\n\"Must you?\" said Rabbit politely.\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"I could stay a little longer if\nit-if you-\" and he tried very hard to look in the\ndirection of the larder.\nDigitized by\n\"As a matter of fact,” said Rabbit, \"I was going\nout myself directly.\"\n\"Oh, well, then, I'll be going on.

I must be going on.\"\n\"\"\nSo he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled\nwith his front paws, and pushed with his back paws,\nand in a little while his nose was out in the open\nagain... and then his ears . . . and then his front\npaws... and then his shoulders... and then--\n25\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh. \"I'd better go back.\"\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Pooh. \"I shall have to go on.\"\n\"I can't do either!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, help and\nbother!\"\nNow by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a\nwalk too, and finding the front door full, he went.\nDigitized by Google\n26\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nout by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and\nlooked at him.\n\"Hallo, are you stuck?\" he asked.\ndo\n\"N-no,\" said Pooh carelessly. \"Just resting and\nthinking and humming to myself.\"\n\"Here, give us a paw.\"\nPooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled\nand pulled and pulled. ...\n\"Ow!\" cried Pooh. \"You're hurting!\"\n\"The fact is,\" said Rabbit, \"you're stuck.\"\n\"It all comes,\" said Pooh crossly, \"of not having\nfront doors big enough.\"\n\"It all comes,\" said Rabbit sternly, \"of eating too\nmuch.
