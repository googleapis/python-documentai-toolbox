And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-\nthe-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his\nnose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\nhot and anxious than ever in his life before. There\nwere four animals in front of them!\n\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nPOOH AND PIGLET HUNT\n39\nas it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle.

Sometimes he thought sadly\nto himself, \"Why?\" and sometimes he thought,\n\"Wherefore?\" and sometimes he thought, \"Inas-\nmuch as which?\"-and sometimes he didn't quite\nknow what he was thinking about. So when Winnie-\nthe-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very\nglad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order\nto say \"How do you do?\" in a gloomy manner to\nhim.\n\"And how are you?\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\nEeyore shook his head from side to side.\n\"Not very how,\" he said. \"I don't seem to have\nfelt at all how for a long time.\"\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I'm sorry about that.\nLet's have a look at you.\"\nSo Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground,\nand Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.\n\"Why, what's happened to your tail?\" he said in\nsurprise.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n44\n\"What has happened to it?\" said Eeyore.\n\"It isn't there!\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\n\"Well, either a tail is there or it isn't there. You\ncan't make a mistake about it. And yours isn't\nthere!\"\n\"Then what is?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Let's have a look,\" said Eeyore, and he turned\nslowly round to the place where his tail had been a\nlittle while ago, and then, finding that he couldn't\ncatch it up, he turned round the other way, until he\ncame back to where he was at first, and then he put\nhis head down and looked between his front legs,\nand at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \"I believe\nyou're right.\"\n\"Of course I'm right,\" said Pooh.\n\"That Accounts for a Good Deal,\" said Eeyore\ngloomily. \"It Explains Everything. No Wonder.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\nEEYORE LOSES A TAIL\n45\n\"You must have left it somewhere,\" said Winnie-\nthe-Pooh.\n\"Somebody must have taken it,\" said Eeyore. \"How\nLike Them,\" he added, after a long silence.\nPooh felt that he ought to say something helpful\nabout it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided\nto do something helpful instead.\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh,\nwill find your tail for you.\"\nn\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You're a\nreal friend,\" said he. \"Not like Some,\" he said.\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.\nIt was a fine spring morning in the forest as he\nstarted out. Little soft clouds played happily in a\nblue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the\nsun as if they had come to put it out, and then slid-\ning away suddenly so that the next might have his\nturn. Through them and between them the sun\nshone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now be-\nside the new green lace which the beeches had put\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n46\non so prettily. Through copse and spinney marched\nBear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over\nrocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone\ninto the heather again; and so at last, tired and hun-\ngry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\n\"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\"\nsaid Bear to himself, \"it's Owl who knows some-\nthing about something,\" he said, “or my name's not\nWinnie-the-Pooh,” he said. “Which it is,” he added.\n\"So there\nyou are.\nOwl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world resi-\ndence of great charm, which was grander than any-\nbody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had\nboth a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the\nknocker there was a notice which said:\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nPLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.\nUnderneath the bell-pull there was a notice which\nsaid:\nPLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.\nThese notices had been written by Christopher\nRobin, who was the only one in the forest who\ncould spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many\nways, able to read and write and spell his own name\nWOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate\nwords like MEASLES and BUTTERED TOAST.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n48\nWINNIE-THE-POOH\nWinnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very care-\nfully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case\nhe had missed some of it, from right to left. Then,\nto make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the\nknocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope,\nand he called out in a very loud voice, “Owl! I re-\nquire an answer! It's Bear speaking.\" And the door\nopened, and Owl looked out.\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore,\nwho is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's\nMoping about it. So could you very kindly tell me\nhow to find it for him?\"\n\"Well,\" said Owl, \"the customary procedure in\nsuch cases is as follows.\"\n\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?” said\nPooh. \"For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and\nlong words, Bother me.\"\n\"It means the Thing to Do.\"\n\"As long as it means that, I don't mind,\" said Pooh\nhumbly.\n\"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Re-\nward. Then--\"\n\"Just a moment,\" said Pooh, holding up his paw.\n“What do we do to this-what you were saying?\nYou sneezed just as you were going to tell me.\"\n\"I didn't sneeze.\"\n\"Yes, you did, Owl.\"\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n"}
